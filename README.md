# 🥋 Kensei – The SocialFi Layer for Meme Coins on SUI
Memes are culture. Let’s make them governable.

Kensei is a SocialFi platform built on the SUI blockchain, designed to transform meme coins from fleeting hype into sustainable, community-driven assets. We provide a social and governance layer that empowers holders, creators, and communities to collaborate, vote, and shape the future of their tokens.

## 🚀 Why Kensei?

Meme coins often lack structure, transparency, and post-launch governance. They're typically launched, pumped, and then abandoned, leaving investors without a say in the project's direction. Kensei addresses this by:

- Providing each meme coin with its own social profile, token feed, and governance layer
- Enabling holders to create proposals and vote on token-related decisions
- Facilitating discussions and updates through on-chain forums and polls
- Allowing easy buying, selling, or swapping of tokens via a natural language chatbot



## 🧱 Core Features

### 1. 🧠 AI Agentic Launchpad

- Create meme coins in seconds using natural language prompts or manual input
- Automatically generate tokens with unique social profiles
- Engage with the community through posts, tags, and social interactions

### 2. 📊 On-Chain Governance

- Token holders can propose and vote on key decisions (e.g., treasury allocation, token burns, liquidity additions)
- Each token has its own forum, polls, and updates, fostering community-driven development

### 3. 🤖 Multi-Agent AI Framework

- **News Agent**: Monitors real-time crypto news
- **Asset Agent**: Facilitates buying, selling, and swapping of tokens
- **AutoShill Agent**: Enhances visibility across social media platforms
- **Whale Watch Agent**: Tracks large-scale transactions
- **Sentiment Agent**: Analyzes cross-platform sentiment

### 4. 💧 Virtual Liquidity via Bonding Curves

- Enables immediate trading of newly created tokens without the need for initial liquidity pools
- Prices adjust automatically as tokens are minted or burned
- Once a token reaches a predefined trading volume, it transitions to a full AMM pool on FlowX DEX using the FlowX TypeScript SDK
